# Switchy

This is fork of original  program.<br>
My knowlage about c++ is too poor. Thats why I trying make more stable programm with differens AI.
They are purposed some modifications.  You can try it by youself in releases.

Switches keyboard layout with the Caps Lock key.

Just put [Switchy.exe] in the startup folder (to open it press **Win+R** and type **shell:startup**).  
If you want to hide the pop-up lang switcher bage in Windows 10/11, put in this folder a shortcut with **nopopup** parameter instead of the file itself.

> Note: for keyboard layout switching to work in programs running with administrator privileges, Switchy must also be run with administrator privileges. This can be automated using Task Scheduler.

Usage:
* **CapsLock** to change keyboard layout  
* **Shift+CapsLock** to toggle CapsLock state
* **Alt+CapsLock** to enable/disable Switchy
